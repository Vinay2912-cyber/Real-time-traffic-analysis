# 🚦 Real-Time Traffic Analysis using Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course in **MCA (Cloud Computing & DevOps)**.  
It demonstrates how **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** can be applied to analyze **real-time traffic data** and determine the **shortest path** between locations.

The system takes city routes and traffic conditions as input and visualizes the shortest path for vehicles using a simple and elegant **Python web interface**.

---

## Objectives
- Implement **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** efficiently.
- Demonstrate its real-world application in **traffic route optimization**.
- Build a clean **web-based interface** using Python (Flask).
- Show how algorithmic concepts help in **smart city traffic systems**.
